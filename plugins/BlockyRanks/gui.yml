# If this value is not 'none', the player rank in the gui will be indicated by the item you specify here.

rank-up-inventory:
  # This is the shape of the inventory gui.
  # The keys/numbers correspond to the rows of the inventory. Keep those in ascending order, starting at 1 and ending at 6!
  # Each row has a list of elements. Keep those at exactly 9 items per row or they will be cropped/filled
  # Each item specified here has to be present the 'items' map below.

    '1': ['1', '1', '1', '2', '2', '2', '3', '3', '3']

  # The keys here are the strings you specified in the rows above. The values have to be valid items.
  # (see the 'player-rank-item' setting for details)
  #
  # The following item specifiers are reserved and special:
  # 'p' -> shows player information and data
  #
  # 'a' -> represents the clickable rankup accept item that shows all requirements and rank info (button)
  #        (if the rankup requirements i.e. money, xp, playtime and mcmmo levels are not sufficiently met,
  #         this item will represent the non-clickable item that shows which requirements are not met and by how much)
  #        (You need this in order for players to rank-up)
  #
  # 'z' -> represents the non-clickable item displaying the rank info and indicating that the player
  #        doesn't meet the requirements to rank up. (sort of like a disabled button)  
  #
  # 'r' -> represents the non-clickable item displaying the rank info
  #
  # 'c' -> represents the clickable cancel item (button) (can be left out, it just closes the inventory gui)
  #
  # You can invent any labels (in the gui/in this list) you want, just make sure to map them to your desired item here
  # Any label present in the gui and not found in this map will be replaced by a non-clickable empty slot in the gui
