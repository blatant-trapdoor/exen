#THIS IS NOT A PERMISSION PROVIDER, MERELY A PLUGIN TO HELP WITH RANKING UP PLAYERS ALONG PREDEFINED

# DON'T DELETE THIS KEY OR CHANGE THE VALUE. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR AUTOMATIC CONFIG UPDATES!

# If this is set to true, when a player ranks up, their old rank is deleted from any database your permissions provider might have.
# Else the new rank just gets added to their ranks. If you wish to demote players it's strongly recommended to set this to true.
# This requires Vault to work.

# This list contains the config files that describe the "per-world" initial branch of your tree.
# That means any players that are not on the rank tree will rank up to the first rank of this initial branch.
# (You can define a separate tree for each world if you want)
initial-branches:
  # Here you can define the default branch that is used for all worlds.
  all-worlds:
    # This enables or disables the whole default-branch-feature
    enabled: true
    # This defines the default branch used in every world by default (this includes the end and the nether worlds!)
    branch: 'peasantry.yml'
    # The worlds you don't want using the default initial branch are specified here
    exempt-worlds:
    - 'sample_world'

  # The values specified next override the all-worlds branch (if you specified any and enabled the feature).
  # The file 'peasantry.yml' here contains the initial tree branch for the world 'sample_world'.
  # You can replace 'sample_world' with the name of your own world and add additional worlds if you want to.
  sample_world: 'peasantry.yml'
  # The Nether and The End are treated as different worlds by minecraft. Thus you can specify
  # different rank trees available to these worlds, compared to the overworld's rank tree.
  sample_world_nether: 'aristocratic.yml'
  sample_world_the_end: 'mercantile.yml'
  # In the above configuration, players who first rank up in the nether would start on the aristocracy branch for example. 
  
# This enables rank sharing over different worlds. 
linked-worlds:
  - ["world", "world_nether", "world_the_end"]
# If a world occurs in more than one of these lists, then the lists are combined.
# So ["world", "world_nether"] and ["world_nether", "world_the_end"] will result in ["world", "world_nether", "world_the_end"]
# Any non-existent worlds will be treated as if they were worlds on another server and exist.
# IMPORTANT: The linked worlds should have the same initial branch or you can lose rank data. 
# (This is not checked as you can link worlds across servers where the initial branch can't be looked up)

# This sound effect is played when a player ranks up.
